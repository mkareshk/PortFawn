## Code Style Guidelines

- **Python Style**: Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- **Type Annotations**: Use type hints wherever possible.
- **Docstrings**: Include clear and concise docstrings in your functions and classes. Use Google-style docstrings.

Example:
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Add two numbers together.

    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the two numbers.
    """
    return a + b
```


## Testing

All new features or fixes should include appropriate tests. We use **pytest** for testing.

Run the full test suite locally:
```bash
make test
```


## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Ensure your PR passes all tests and CI checks.
2. Include detailed descriptions of your changes.
3. Keep your PR focused on a single issue or feature.
4. Use descriptive titles and link to relevant issues.


## Community Guidelines

- Be respectful and inclusive.
- Follow [GitHub's Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines).
